My name is Chase.  I am a father of 4 wonderful boys and husband to a beautiful, AMAZING wife(Colette) of almost 20 years.  OH, and now we have a dog named Ginny, too(she's a chiweenie). 

I love music--ESPECIALLY piano, and my wife and I are known ""foodies"" in the DFW area.  I own a T-shirt company in Rockwall, and I spend most of my time raising boys and working around the house.

I am an avid traveler, and frequenter of BnBs around the world. 
 But as a native Texan, there's nothing I love more than coming home to these endless Texas skies.  So much open air to breathe and possibilities to explore!
